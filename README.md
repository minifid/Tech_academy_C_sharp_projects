# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

## Projects:
- BlackJack
- Car Insurance

### BlackJack
This is a console application for the common game BlackJack. Allows you to place bets and play against the dealer increasing/decreasing your imaganary balance. Will also log all the cards dealt, and displays exceptions to the admin

###CarInsurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issues
